# Capture-Disaster
Providing solution for post disaster management for codefundo++ conducted by Microsoft

## IDEA
Challenge faced during disaster management  is sharing information among organisation due to lack of interoperability. In a disasater management situation, information is widely distributed and owned by different organisation which do not have any means to share resources with other teams. 

We will be creating a web app where we can get real time information about disaster  prone areas using tweets on twitter ,  web scrapping, on the basis of weather pattern in an area in real-time. Users in disaster prone areas can provide their information like location, text, voice clipping, photos . On the basis of the information gathered the  prone area will be highlighted on google map with the contents provided by user. This information can be accessed by anybody. 

We are aiming at efficient sharing of real-time information and resources among disaster management organisations/teams. We will be providing a platform for relief team working in the prone area to relay their information  to other teams regarding resource or aid needed  in that area. Relief team will be providing their contact numbers on which victims can contact them through SMS. To enhance the interaction among various disaster managment organisations and among teams in an organisation we will be providing a chatroom separately. This can be an efficient method for resource managment. 

If we get information about safe areas in a prone city we can mark those areas as safe on google map and this can be used by relief team to move victims to those areas. Safest or shortest path to those areas will be suggested.   

On the basis of real time information gathered  from map, chats and web scarapping we will be analyzing most prone areas in a city using Big Data and provide suggestion to relief team to provide help in those areas.  

This can also work in areas with limited network.
